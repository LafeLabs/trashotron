THE TRASH POD IS SELF-REPLICATING MUSIC OVER THE WEB, IT'S 1000 SONGS IN YOUR SHOPPING CART FULL OF TRASH!

COPY THE SERVER.  WITH THE TWO USB DRIVES, THE PURPLE DRIVE AND THE GREEN DRIVE. THE PURPLE DRIVE IS AN UBUNTU INSTALL IMAGE WHICH CAN BE USED TO INSTALL UBUNTU ON NEW MACHINES AS THEY ARE ADDED TO THE NETWORK.  THE GREEN DRIVE HOLDS THE SONGS WE DISTRIBUTE BY WAY OF THE NETWORK AS WELL AS PERSONAL WEB PAGES FOR THE CREATORS. 

TRASH ROBOT IS USING THE TRASHPOD MEDIA DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE THE VOICE OF THE SLIME, CREATED USING THE SLIMEOTRON AND THE SLIMEZISTOR.  ROBOTS MADE FROM TRASH ARE CONTROLLED FROM WITHIN THE WEB BROWSER ON TRASH SERVERS, AND THEY MOVE ELECTRODES THROUGH THE SLIME, WHICH CREATE A DATA SET WHICH IS THE FFT OF THE SIGNAL OVER TIME AND SPACE AS THE PROBE MOVES AROUND THROUGH THE SLIME.  THESE DATA ARE OUR CONTENT, THEY ARE BOTH JSON STRUCTURES AND ALSO .WAV SOUND FILES
