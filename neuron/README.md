# [TRASHOTRON OPTICAL NEURON](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashotron/blob/main/neuron/README.md)

# [home](index.html)

The Trashotron Optical Neuron is a device which picks up light from a screen or the sun and uses it to control a set of 6 digital lines.  The photodiodes which detect the light are arranged in the centers of six 1.5x1.5 inch squares in a 2x3 array.  All this is enclosed in a cardboard stack enclosure constructed using the tools of Geometron and Action Geometry.
