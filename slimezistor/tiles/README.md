# [TILES!](https://github.com/lafelabs/tiles)

GEOMETRIC SOCIAL MEDIA!

### [HOME](index.html)

When you join the board, you get at tile.  Put a name and hyperlink url in from your tile. Move your tile around by rotating it, moving it forward and back, and deleting actions until it's situated.
Set the tile message.  

That's all.  We join the board, get a tile, place the tile, create a link, name and message for the tile, and either join again or step back and watch as other people build out the board.
