## SlimeZistor

### what is this and why did we build it and what can it do? 

1. speak of cybernetics and feedback loops
2. speak of what we want to communicate with
3. show it working in the field
4. walk through the circuit and show how it works

### Build the electronics kit

1. buy all the parts
2. Color code the capacitors and board
2. put it all in a ziploc bag for distribution
3. go find a USB thingy of some kind
4. go find an audio cable of some kind
5. find random wires

### Construct the mechanicals

1. 1x4 inch ruler from pcb
2. 4 inch square from ruler
3. square stack
4. cut out cutouts
5. glue
6. top decoration
7. bottom decoration
8. QR codes on a square as replicator

## Optical Neuron

### What is it and why did we build it and what can it do?

0. trash magic and building everything from trash
1. background: the trashDuino and programming with trash, working from the browser
2. the power of p5js and geometron libraries
3. show it working and show a few assembled units

### Build the electronics kit

 - buy the parts
 - put together in ziploc bag
 - assemble

### Build the mechanicals

 - use driver board to make a basic card
 - use the ruler and neuron board to make the pattern for the sides
 - use the ruler to make the pattern for the holes(this could use work, make them narrower maybe), maybe make a little tube around each diode 


### Control things with it

 - various screens
 - run with driver for DVD drives 
 - run with driver for wall robot
