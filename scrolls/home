TRASHOTRON is a self-replicating set consisting of:

 - the geometron language and the books which document it
 - action geometry, self-replicating geometric constructions in trash using geometron
 - the trash magic philosophy and books documenting it
 - the arduino based trash robot icon printer(prints on trash)
 - the arduino based trash robot microscope(images trash in 3d)
 - the spray paint wall printer
 - this document, the TRASHONOMICON which replicates the set
 - the trash magic server and web framework including CSS and js
 - the trashotron optical neuron which converts pixels on a screen into digital outputs
 - the trashotron driver which translates digital signals to stepper motor control using an analog circuit for a clock
 - [the slimezistor synthesizer and electrical probe for both science and music and technology](scrolls/slimezistor)
