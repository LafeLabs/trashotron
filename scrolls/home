# TRASHONOMICON

TRASHOTRON is the unification of Geometron and Trash Magic.  Trash Magic is the philosophy of building a new civilization entirely from the waste streams of the old one and things we can grow or gather right where we are.  Geometron is a geometric language for the control of machines.

This is a [TRASHBOOK](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashbook/) which replicates the [trashotron](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashotron/) set.

TRASHOTRON is a self-replicating set consisting of:
