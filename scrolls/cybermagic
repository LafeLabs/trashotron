[REPLICATE THE TRASH MAGIC CYBER MAGIC SET!](https://github.com/lafelabs/trashmagic)

[TRASH MAGIC QUANTUM TAROT AT QUANTUMART.ORG](https://www.quantumart.org)

CYBERMAGIC IS A SYSTEM OF SELF-REPLICATING SETS OF FILES!

IT INCLUDES HTML, MARKDOWN, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, JSON, CSS, AND GEOMETRON!  

IT CAN INCLUDE PYTHON AS NEEDED FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AND MACHINE LEARNING!

 - [editor.php](editor.php)
 - [webeditor.html](webeditor.html)
 - [dnagenerator.php](dnagenerator.php)
 - [data/dna.txt](data/dna.txt)
 - [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt)

THERE ARE FIVE ELEMENTS OF CODE: 

```
{
WATER:HTML,
FIRE:JAVASCRIPT,
AETHER:PHP,
AIR:CSS,
EARTH:GEOMETRON
}
```

PHP SCRIPTS REPLICATE THE WHOLE SET OF CODE!

PHP SCRIPTS ALLOW FOR HTML FILES TO EDIT EVERYTHING USING FILESAVER.PHP AND FILELOADER.PHP!

JSON FILES LIST ALL THE FILES WHICH ARE TO BE COPIED!

ALL JSON FILES ARE STORED IN THE "DATA" FOLDER!

PHP FILES ARE STORED IN .TXT FORMAT IN THE "PHP" FOLDER SO THAT THERE IS A STATIC INSTANCE OF THEM WHICH CAN BE EDITED LIVE!

THESE PHP FILES ARE "COMPILED" BY COPYING ALL OF THEM INTO THE MAIN WEB DIRECTORY (/VAR/WWW/HTML) WITH THE SCRIPT [TEXT2PHP.PHP](text2php.php)!

THE PRIMARY REPLICATOR SCRIPT WHICH COPIES ALL THE OTHER FILES IS CALLED REPLICATOR.PHP AND IT USES A JSON FILE CALLED [DNA.TXT](data/dna.txt) TO COPY EVERYTHING!

TRASHBOOKS ARE SETS OF SELF-REPLICATING [MARKDOWN](https://www.markdownguide.org/) DOCUMENTS CALLED SCROLLS!

MARKDOWN IS CONVERTED INTO HTML USING THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY [SHOWDOWN.JS](https://showdownjs.com/)!

MATH IS CONVERTED FROM LATEX TO HTML USING THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY [MATHJAX.JS](https://www.mathjax.org/)!

UNCOMMENT THE MATHJAX RELATED CODE IN INDEX.HTML AND USER.PHP TO MAKE A TRASHBOOK INSTANCE RUN LATEX!

YOU CAN ALSO SEE MATH TYPESETTING WITH [MATHUSER.PHP](mathuser.php?scroll=scrolls/CYBERMAGIC)!

$$
\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V\Psi = E\Psi
$$

ALL CODE IN THE SYSTEM IS EDITED USING THE PROGRAM [EDITOR.PHP](editor.php) WHICH USES THE JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY [ACE.JS](https://ace.c9.io/)!

CODE WHICH EXISTS IN THE TOP LEVEL WEB DIRECTORY IS EDITED USING THE PROGRAM [WEBEDITOR.HTML](webeditor.html)!

TOP LEVEL CODE IS DESTROYED USING THE WEB DESTROYER LOCATED AT [WEBDESTROYER.HTML](webdestroyer.html)!

TO REPLICATE A TRASHBOOK INSTANCE TO A NEW INSTANCE, EDIT THE CODE IN REPLICATOR.PHP USING EDITOR.PHP TO POINT TO THE CORRECT URLS FOR BOTH THE FILE REPLICATOR.TXT AND DNA.TXT, THEN RUN TEXT2PHP.PHP TO "COMPILE" IT!

USE THE NEW REPLICATOR WHICH WILL REPLICATE THE NEW INSTANCE TO REPLICATE TO ANOTHER SERVER!  

YOU CAN RUN REPLICATOR FROM THE COMMAND LINE USING PHP!

```
cd /var/www/html
php replicator.php
```
YOU CAN ALSO USE EDITOR.PHP TO REPLACE ANY REPLICATOR WITH ANY OTHER REPLICATOR, COMPILE IT WITH TEXT2PHP.PHP AND REPLICATE A TRASHBOOK INSTANCE USING THE NEW REPLICATOR!

YOU CAN USE [GITHUB](https://github.com/LafeLabs/trashbook) TO CREATE QUASI-STATIC REPOSITORIES WHICH ARE REPLICATED GLOBALLY!

ALWAYS POST ALL CODE ON GITHUB IN CC0 PUBLIC DOMAIN!

WE DO NOT WORK WITH ANY COPYRIGHT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS! 

THIS CODE IS "FREE" NOT LIKE "OVERPAID MIT PROFESSOR" BUT LIKE FOOD NOT BOMBS!

EDITOR.PHP AND WEBEDITOR.HTML BOTH ALSO EDIT PYTHON CODE WHICH CAN BE PLACED IN THE TOP LEVEL WEB FOLDER!

USE PYTHON TO DO SCIENCE!

USE PYTHON TO CREATE [LANGUAGE MODELS](scrolls/ML) TO EVOLVE THIS DOCUMENT!

CONNECT THE EVOLVING PYTHON LANGUAGE MODELS WITH THE PHP AND THE CLIENT SIDE HTML INTERACTION WHERE PEOPLE WILL CO-EVOLVE THE SWARM OF CODE WHICH BUILDS THE WHOLE SYSTEM!
