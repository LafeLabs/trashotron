# TRASHOTRON OPTICAL NEURON


The optical neuron reads out six PD204-6C photodiodes with three dual-channel [LM358](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LM358) [operational amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier) in the 8 pin DIP configuration.  30 megaohm bias resistors are used to set the gain for the 6 channels.  0.1 microfarad capacitors are used to filter the power supplies.  An 8 pin header connects to the ribbon cable.

The Trashotron Optical Neuron connects to the [trashotron driver](scrolls/driver) by way of an [8 pin ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0789F2Y1T).

To build a Trashotron Neuron, it's probably best to assemble enough parts to build a bunch because of economies of scale.  Buy at least 10 circuit boards, and it's probably best to get them along with the [driver](scrolls/driver) board and also the [slimezistor](scrolls/slimezistor) as well as the parts for those.  

That said, the optical neuron can also be a product by itself, and can be used with breadboards to do any kind of digital control from a web browser.
