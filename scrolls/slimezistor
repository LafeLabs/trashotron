# THE SCROLL OF SLIME
 
What is the slimezistor?

The slimezistor is a [relaxation oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator) in which a capacitor is charged and discharged through some type of slime which is connected to a pair of electrodes.  The resistance of the slime determines the rate of charge/discharge of the capacitor and hence the frequency.  Any nonlinearities in the current-voltage characteristic of the slime are represented by changes in the frequency components in the output signal on the speaker.  

Thus we are creating a sort of synthesizer in which the frequency of the tone is set by the resistance of the slime and the shape of the waveform is set by the nonlinear characteristics or time dependent dynamics of the slime system.

The slimezistor has a USB power input which can be driven directly off a solar USB charger, and has an audio output cable which can go into a speaker on battery(like a Bluetooth speaker).  Then there are two electrodes coming out of the square which connect to the slime.  The enclosure is made from a stack of 4 inch squares of corrugated cardboard we can get from trash.  We can distribute the slimezistor using the TRASH CARTS.

We must first create kits for distribution. To do that we will do decentralized manufacturing, where people all over the world will buy the circuit boards and parts and sell kits to people who will assemble the kits and sell the completed slimezistor as a synth unit.

You can either buy the circuit boards in a bulk order from pcbway.com or you can modify the designs in Eagle and get your own made.

 - [download Eagle .sch file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashotron/main/boards/trashotron-slimezistor.sch) 

The needed parts for this kit are LM358 op amps, 10k axial resistors, 0.1 microfarad capacitors, 0.47 microfarad capacitors, and 10 microfarad capacitors, as well as some headers and USB cables we get from the trash and audio cables we get from the trash and speakers we find or get from the trash.  

We will assemble kits and distribute them.  You can buy all the parts for a kit and give the kits away or sell them and assemble them into slimezistors which you give away or sell.  

We color code the boards and capacitors using a paint pen and color the 0.1 uF capacitors red, the 0.47 uF capacitors green, and the 10 uF capacitors blue.  Then we do this on the board as well. Note that 0.1 uF is "104" in the capacitor code, which represents 10 times 10 to the fourth power picofarads, which is 1e5 times 1e-12 or 1e-7 or 0.1e-6. Similarly, 0.47 uF is "474" and 10 uF is "106".

These are the kit parts:

Having gathered the electrical parts, you want to use the circuit board to make a 1x4 inch ruler from cereal box cardboard, which you will use to construct a square with a hole in it which can be used to replicate all the layers of the enclosure.  

Use the ruler to make a 4 inch square with a 1x2 inch cutout in the center which the circuit board will sit in.  Cut it all out with a box cutter.  Make three of those: one which will sit directly around the circuit board, one which will be cut up and surround the wires in and wires out and one for replication.  Copy the schematic on paper, cut that out and glue to the bottom.  Copy the top as shown.  Make extras with cardboard trash that you can give away or sell on the street, connected to the trash servers and trash books.

If you want to not buy circuit boards, you can use cardboard cereal boxes as boards instead, with the following design:

The circuit board is a 1x2 inch rectangle cut out of thin cardboard like a cereal box:

Remove pins 1,2, and 3 of the 8 pin IC:

Assemble as follows, with 0.1 uF capacitor to the far left, then 1 uF and then the two to the far right which are horizontal are the 10 uF capacitors:

This is a 5x blowup of the board, with parts labeled. Replicate this as a tool for replication to carry with you as you replicate the set:

An array can also be cut out using a laser cutter with the following .svg file(cut out a 4 inch square of this, with the blue layer as raster and black layer as cut):
