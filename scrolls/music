The Trash Magic network is a music distribution system based on distribution of free physical hardware which contains the music.  We collect donated laptops from waste streams, put Trash Magic servers on them, and then make folders for music collections, put them on the laptops, and point Trash Magic Web Pages to them on the server. We then put those servers onto the local wireless networks in venues and anyone on the wifi in that venue can see the web page with the music listed.  

Self-replicating web pages are created with all the information required to support the musician who created the music as well as the venue who supports the network.
