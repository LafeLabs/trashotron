We construct maximalist fashion out of found materials and distribute them for free.  Make FREE PANTS and distribute them for free. 

These pants are self-replicating.  You wear pants that say "free pants" and when people ask you about them you pull another set of cut out letters which say "free pants" out of your pocket and offer them. The next person then goes and finds another pair of pants in the trash and sews the letters on them, and then cuts out another set of letters to carry around in their own copy of the FREE PANTS and the cycle repeats.
