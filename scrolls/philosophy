# Philosophy
 
Our current civilization is based on mining and numbers.  We dig things up out of the ground, set them on fire, and bury them.  All of our actions in this process are ordered by means of a numbers-based world view.  Numbers for money, numbers for stocks, numbers for labor, numbers for material, and the numbers-based religion of computers.  

In Trash Magic and Geometron we imagine a world based not on numbers but on geometry and replication.    Trash Magic is the creation of things from trash which contain the means of their own replication.  Geometron is a geometric meta-language.  That is, it is a language for building languages, using pure geometry.  Geometry builds symbols which represent geometric actions.  These actions are used to control machines which impose order on physical matter, and are thus used to create technology.

 - everything is fractal
